# AssemblyCalculatorProject

This is an old Calculator project written in Assembly ;)

## Files

* `calc.asm` - The whole assembly code responsible for operating the calculator.

* `s.bmp` - The initial image which pops up when starting the calculator.

* `c.bmp` - The base image of the calculator. Upon this base image the calculator will display its logic.

* `examples/*` - The examples files showing actual usage of the calculator. It has some interesting cases!


**__NOTE:__** This code was from my highschool's finals project. It should definitely receive a refactorization!
